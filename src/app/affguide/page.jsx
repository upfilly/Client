        What Is Affiliate Marketing and How Does It Work?
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg mb-8 text-center">
        Affiliate marketing is a simple but powerful way to grow a business — and earn money by promoting the products you love. Whether you're a brand looking to scale or a content creator wanting to monetize your audience, affiliate marketing connects the two sides in a win-win partnership.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Let’s break it down.</h2>

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">The Basics</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>A merchant (brand) sets up an affiliate program — offering a commission for every sale that comes from a partner's referral.</li>
            <li>An affiliate (creator, blogger, influencer) joins the program and gets a special tracking link.</li>
            <li>The affiliate promotes the product through content, ads, or social media.</li>
            <li>When someone clicks that link and makes a purchase, the affiliate gets paid.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">It’s like word-of-mouth marketing — but smarter, scalable, and trackable.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Everyone Wins</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>Merchants only pay for actual sales. No upfront ad spend. No guesswork.</li>
            <li>Affiliates earn money for driving results — without creating their own products.</li>
            <li>Customers get to discover trusted products through people they follow.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Real-Life Example</h3>
          <p>
            Let’s say <strong>Maria</strong> is a fitness blogger. She signs up for a protein brand’s affiliate program on Upfilly. She writes a review post with her unique link. Her audience clicks the link, buys the product, and Maria earns 15% commission on every sale.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">Maria helps her followers. The brand grows its customer base. Maria gets paid. Everyone wins.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What Makes Affiliate Marketing Work</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Audiences convert best when they trust the affiliate's opinion.</li>
            <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Niche affiliates perform better because they promote what their audience actually cares about.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Clear tracking, fair commissions, and consistent payouts keep the ecosystem healthy.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why It’s Growing Fast</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>Ad costs are rising.</li>
            <li>Social media influencers are everywhere.</li>
            <li>People trust peer recommendations more than ads.</li>
            <li>Merchants want cost-effective growth. Affiliates want flexible income. Affiliate marketing delivers both.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Key Takeaways</h3>
          <p>Affiliate marketing is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It’s a long-term, performance-driven channel that rewards quality content, trust, and consistency.</p>
          <p className="mt-2">Whether you're a merchant or affiliate, platforms like <strong>Upfilly</strong> make it easier than ever to get started — with no tech headaches.</p>
